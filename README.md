# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to determine how many current employees will soon be eligible for retirement at Pewlett Hackard. The management would also like to identify current employees who would be able to take part in a mentorship program to fill positions once these employees retire. The mentorship program would help these employees learn the positions of the retiring employees so that the business can continue to function effectively.

## Results

1. There are 90,398 employees of retirement age at Pewlett Hackard. Employees are eligible to retire if their birth dates are between 1/1/1952 and 12/31/1955 and if their hire dates are between 1/1/1985 and 12/31/1988.

## Summary

The results from the retirement analysis show that Pewlett Hackard has a potential problem in the next few years as the number of employees at retirement age is substantial (90,398) when compared to the total number of current employees (240,124). The percentage of total employees eligible for retirement is 37.6%.

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the majority of the retiring employees (63.8%) are senior-level employees. Pewlett Hackard wants to implement a mentorship program to mitigate the loss of so many employees; however, there are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program compared to the 90,398 employees who will be retiring. 

Another issue is that out of the 90,398 retiring employees, the Development department (23,974), the Production department (20,236) and the Sales department (14,609) will be impacted especially heavily by the retirements. Hiring and mentorship programs should be focused on these departments.

The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program (1,549) will not be sufficient to cover the gap that the retiring employees will create, even if there is an extensive hiring program. If Pewlett Hackard hired replacement employees for all the retiring employees, there would be only one mentor for every 58 new hires. 

One suggestion would be for Pewlett Hackard to increase the range of employees who are eligible for the mentorship program to those born in a 5-year period (1/1/1963 to 12/31/1968) rather than a one-year period (1/1/1965 to 12/31/1965). The number of mentors would increase from 1,549 in the one-year period (one mentor for every 58.36 vacancies) to 38,401 eligible for the mentorship (one mentor for every 2.35 vacancies).

As the "silver tsunami" descends on Pewlett Hackard, the company needs to implement an aggressive hiring program. To spread out the impact of retirements, the company could also offer incentives for retiring employees to extend their work and join the mentorship program for a couple of years. Another suggestion would be to increase the range of employees eligible for the mentorship program so that there will be more employees available to train new employees. In the future, Pewlett Hackard should anticipate and prepare well in advance to hire new employees prior to a large group of potential retirements.
